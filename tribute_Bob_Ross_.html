                <p><label class='bullet-points'><b class="color" style='background:transparent'>29 October 1942: Born in Daytona Beach, Florida, USA</b> to Jack and Ollie Ross, and raised in <b class="color" style='background:transparent'>Orlando, Florida</b></p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>As an adolescent, Ross cared for injured animals, including armadillos, snakes, alligators and squirrels, etc.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>Ross dropped out of high school in 9th grade. While working as a carpenter with his father, he lost a part of his left index finger.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>In 1961, 18 year old Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force and was put into service as a medical records technician.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>He rose to the rank of Master Sergeant and served as the first sergeant of the clinic at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>Having held military positions that required him to act tough and mean, "the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work", Ross decided he would not raise his voice when he left the military.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>During his 20 year Air Force career, Ross developed an interest in painting. He found himself frequently at odds with many of his painting instructors.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>Ross was working as a part-time bartender when he discovered a TV show called <a class="color" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_of_Oil_Painting' targey="_blank" style='background:transparent'>The Magic of Oil Painting</a>, hsoted by German painter Bill Alexander.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>He retired from the Air Force in 1981 and returned to Florida, studied painting with Alexander, and became a traveling salesman and tutor. Annette Kowalski, who had attended one of his sessions in Clearwater, Florida, convinced Ross he could succeed on his own. Ross, his wife, Annette and Walt, her husband, pooled their money to create his company.</p></label> 
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>In 1982, a station in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia" class="color" target="_blank" style='background:transparent'>Falls Church, Virginia</a>, aired a taping of his art class as a pilot, and 60 PBS stations signed up for the show in the first year. In 1983, PBS station WIPB lured him to Muncie, Indiana, with the promise of creative freedom, and he found a kinship with the staff.</p></label>
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>The show ran from January 11, 1983, to May 17, 1994, but reruns to continue to appear in many broadcast areas and countries.</p></label>
                <p><label class='bullet-points'>He died at the age of 52 on July 4, 1995, in Orlando, Florida due to complications from Lymphoma.</b></p></label>
